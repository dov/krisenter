# Introduction


![Krisenter screenshot](doc/krisenter-screenshot.png)

Krisenter is a Krita plugin for viewing a pdf file as a presentation. It is a very hackish way of using Krita in a way that it was not intended for. Still, it offers a way of interacting with pdf presentations in a way that no other tool that I'm aware of does.

# License

Krisenter is licensed under the same license as krita, GPL v3.

The installation has currently only been tested on a Linux box. I'll be happy to receive contributions for other platforms.
